# belly-button-challenge

- This challenge was to build a dashboard to display data from a study on the variety of bacteria found in the belly button. A series of functions were created to collect data from a url and make two charts. After using D3 to get the json data from the website, a function was designed to collect the personal information for each test subject and display it on the dashboard. Next, a function to build the two charts was designed. D3 was once again used to collect the json data and multiple variables were seperated out. A bubble chart was built using Plotly that used variables to determine the size and the color of the bubbles. Then a bar chart was built, also using Plotly, that showed the top 10 bacteria found on each test subject. A third function was made to to collect all of the id numbers and insert them into the dropdown menu and the '.on' method was used to provide a way for the user to switch through all of the id numbers and display their charts. Finally, a function was created that builds the charts as needed and displays them on the dashboard when the user selects through the data.
